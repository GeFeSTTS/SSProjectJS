                <h2>G-SHOCK <b>STORY</b></h2>
                <p>Over 30 years ago, a CASIO engineer won the battle against the laws of nature. He designed a watch
                    that would resist centrifugal and impact forces, as well as high water pressure. Since then, the
                    name G-SHOCK has become a byword for independence and pushing the limits.</p>
                <p>Here you will learn more about the concept and development of the toughest watches in the world.</p>
                <img src="./assets/img/philosophie-header.jpg" alt="Hand with G-Shock watch">
                <p class="history">G-SHOCK was developed at a time when watches were still fragile instruments. It all began with a
                    young CASIO engineer who dreamed of "designing a watch that would not break even when dropped".</p>
                <p class="history">After causing a stir back in 1974 with its first digital wristwatches, CASIO has had a significant
                    influence on the watch market since the 1980s with the development of the virtually indestructible
                    G-SHOCK wristwatch. The first G-SHOCK, the DW5000, came onto the market in 1983. An unparalleled
                    success story followed as the G-SHOCK models, with their corners and edges, became an international
                    favourite among urban youth.</p>
                <p class="history">The shock-proof G-SHOCK watches quickly became the epitome of robustness, innovation and
                    multifunctionality. At last, enthusiasts could keep their wristwatches on while skateboarding or
                    riding their BMX bikes. Falls and knocks are no problem for the G-SHOCK. Whether for everyday use,
                    playing sport or under extreme outdoor conditions, G-SHOCK watches have been genuine all-rounders
                    and reliable companions in every situation for almost 35 years. Today, G-SHOCK has earned the
                    privilege of being worn by men who are not willing to accept limits.</p>
